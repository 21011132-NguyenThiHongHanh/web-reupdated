# Course Overview

<UnderDevelopment display={false} />

## Course Description

This course provides an introduction to human-computer interaction and the design process.
Students will learn methods and skills for designing and prototyping interactive systems.
The course covers a design process from the initial formulation of a design problem to creation of digital prototypes.
Importantly, the course does not emphasize development but instead fully focuses on design.

The course structure is a mix of lectures, hands-on activities, and design critiques by peers and course staff.
The course is overwhelmingly organized around a group project, in which students:

- Ideate and Propose Design Problems
- Study Existing Practices and Challenges
- Explore Potential Design Opportunities and Tradeoffs
- Evaluate and Iterate Upon a Design
- Communicate a Problem and Resulting Design

## Learning Objectives

- Process-Focused Perspective on Interaction Design
- Design Research Methods and Skills
- Task-Focused Scenario Development, Sketching, and Storyboarding
- Rapid Prototyping and Iteration
- Critical Perspective on Design Solutions

## Grading

Strive to do good work because you care about your own opportunities to learn,
including the opportunities this course provides working with a group in an intensive project.

The overall course grade will be computed as follows:

- __10%__: Participation (CC1 & CC2)
- __30%__: Mid-Term
- __60%__: Group Project
  - __5%__: <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.assignmentsAssignment1Top} outerComponent="span" />: Project Proposal
    - 1a: Individual Brainstorm
    - 1b: Group Proposals
    - 1c: Finalized Proposal
  - __15%__: <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.assignmentsAssignment2Top} outerComponent="span" />: Getting the Right Design
    - 2b: Design Research Plan 
    - 2c: Design Research Check-In
    - 2d: Design Research Review
    - 2e: Task Review
    - 2f: Design Check-In
    - 2g: Design Review
    - 2p: Getting the Right Design Presentation
  - __15%__: <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.assignmentsAssignment3Top} outerComponent="span" />: Getting the Design Right
    - 3a: Paper Prototype
    - 3c: Usability Testing Check-In
    - 3d: Usability Testing Review
    - 3e: Digital Mockup
    - 3p: Getting the Design Right Presentation
  - __25%__: <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.assignmentsAssignment4Top} outerComponent="span" />: Communicating the Design
    - 4web: Web Post
    - 4poster: Poster and Pitch
    - Individual Presentation Delivery

Each assignment will also provide a point breakdown intended to convey how it will be graded.
Design is an inherently subjective practice, and so grading in this course is necessarily subjective.
The stated project requirements are the minimum,
intended to leave room for groups to earn strong grades through strong work.

Because the course is designed around feedback on project milestones, grades given to those milestones indicate
that you have invested sufficient effort and insight at the time of the milestone.
You will get feedback and are expected to continue acting upon that feedback in your design process.
The bulk of project grades is therefore attached to the final deliverables, which are evaluated on their quality.

### Late Policy
We generally expect all assignments will be submitted according to the deadline in Canvas and the assignment description.
This is a fast-paced course, with many elements of the project depending on prior elements.
The course staff's ability to give feedback also relies on timely submissions
(e.g., course staff will often review submissions soon after they are submitted to be ready for course activities).

If your group feels that you would really benefit from an extension,
or if there is an emergency impacting your ability to submit an assignment,
contact the course staff before the submission deadline.

We will do our best to be flexible and work with you so that your group stays on track.
Extensions of a few hours can often be facilitated.
Except in extreme circumstances, we will typically not be able to give an extension of more than 1 day.


### Expectation of In-Person Participation

The course heavily emphasizes a group project and participation in associated in-class activities.
In-person participation is expected for both lecture and section,
is part of participation grading,
and can also impact grading of your contribution to the group project.
